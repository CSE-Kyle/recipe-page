### What I learned

Learning how to organize and align data by using the table semantic.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Calories</td>
    <td class="value">277kcal</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Carbs</td>
    <td class="value">0g</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Protein</td>
    <td class="value">20g</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Fat</td>
    <td class="value">22g</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

### Continued development

- improve my positioning of HTML elements with CSS using Flexbox and Grid. Whether if it's photos, text, etc. 

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp) - A primary internet resource that I used for researching on how to create tables and being specific on selecting certain elements in HTML and editing the CSS properties to go with it.
- [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/) - Another resource I referred to anytime I visually need to see how certain HTML/CSS properties change when done so.
- [figma](https://www.figma.com) - Design tool that I use to see the design specifications so that I can convert them into code.
